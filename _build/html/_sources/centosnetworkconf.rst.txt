An alternative for the nmcli is the nmtui, short for Network Manager Text User Interface, the nmtui is yet another handy tool that allows you to easily configure your network interfaces in Linux distributions using a graphical display by invoking the nmtui command straight from the terminal or even putty.
To configure a network interface IPv4 address, start by invoking the nmtui tool.

**$ nmtui**

Select the first option ‘Edit a connection’ and hit ENTER.
