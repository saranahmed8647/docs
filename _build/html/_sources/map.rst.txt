Using this module the on boarded hosts can be viewed on MAP (openstreetmap) with respect to their geographic locations. An open-source module MAP and MAP Datatype has been integrated with NMS web portal. Location coordinates (Latitude & Longitude values) of devices are needed to display them on MAP. Interactive values are shown on map with redirect links.ready created open source module MAP and MAP Datatype has been integrated to NMS web portal, for every host it requires coordinates(latitude and longitude values), so it can then be display on map through that value.Interactive values shown on map with redirect links.
