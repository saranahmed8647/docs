5. Firewall Outbound NAT
************************
Outbound NAT determines how traffic leaving a Firewall® system will be translated.

Outbound NAT does not control which interface traffic will leave, only how traffic is handled as it exits. 

Outbound NAT is configured under **Firewall > NAT** on the Outbound tab.

Automatic Outbound NAT
**********************
The default “Automatic” scenario is to have all traffic that enters from a LAN (or LAN type) interface to have NAT applied so it is translated to the WAN IP address before it leaves.

For static IP configurations, an interface is considered a WAN by the presence of a gateway on the interface’s settings, e.g. **Interfaces > OPT1**. Having a gateway defined under System > Routing is not enough, it must also be selected on the interface configuration or it will not be considered a WAN for NAT or other purposes.

Manual/Advanced Outbound NAT Settings
**************************************
In order to use Manual/Advanced Outbound NAT rules, navigate to **Firewall > NAT** on the Outbound tab and select Manual Outbound NAT rule generation (AON - Advanced Outbound NAT), and save. The list should then be populated with the equivalent of the automatic rules, which can then be edited, deleted, or added as needed.
There are a several more possibilities with outbound NAT rules beyond the standard address fields:

Protocol Choice
***************
A protocol may be specified for outbound NAT traffic. This would allow for outbound PPTP to use a separate IP, for instance.

Address Pools
*************
Address pools allow use of a subnet or list of external IP addresses when performing outbound NAT as opposed to the traditional situation which translates traffic to a single external address. Multiple external addresses can help in situations where the resources of a single external IP may not be enough for a large number of internal users.

Choosing Addresses for a Pool
*****************************

Address pools for outbound NAT translations may be used in several ways:

*	A Proxy ARP VIP subnet (ex: 10.10.10.128/29) shows up in the drop-down for translation target

*	An alias of IP addresses can be chosen from the drop-down list (note: See limitations below)

*	By choosing Other Subnet from the drop-down list, any arbitrary subnet can be used.

Address Pool Options
********************
When an address pool is used, there are several options available that control how NAT translations happen on the pool. These options are:

*	Round Robin

Loops through the translation addresses one at a time in sequence.

*	Random

Selects an address from the pool at random.

*	Source Hash

Uses a hash of the source address to determine the translation address, ensuring that the redirection address is always the same for a given source.

*	Bitmask

Applies the subnet mask and keeps the last portion identical; 10.0.1.50 -> x.x.x.50.

*	Sticky Address variants of Random and Round Robin types

The Sticky Address option can be used with the Random and Round Robin pool types to ensure that a particular source address is always mapped to the same translation address, so long as a state exists for a given internal IP. If all of an internal system’s states expire, it may get a different translation IP for the next external connection.
Limitations

Only Round Robin types work with Host Aliases. Any type can be used with a Proxy ARP or “Other Subnet” pool.

Disable NAT
***********
To completely disable NAT to have a routing-only firewall, do the following:

*	Navigate to Firewall > NAT on the Outbound tab

*	Select Disable Outbound NAT rule generation (No Outbound NAT rules)

*	Click Save

*	Apply changes

NAT may be performed on some interfaces and not others by configuring Outbound NAT rules accordingly.

Disable NAT and Firewall
************************
To completely disable NAT and all firewall functions from all interfaces, do the following. Note that the previous section (“Disable NAT”) is skipped when taking this approach.

*	Navigate to System > Advanced on the Firewall / NAT tab

*	Check Disable Firewall / Disable all packet filtering

*	Click Save
